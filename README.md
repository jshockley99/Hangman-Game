# Hangman Game
Hangman is based on the traditional hangman game with a twist. It's implemented with HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, and JQuery. 

### Rules
* Initially, a random "scary themed" word will appear on the page. It will be encrypted with blanks. Each blank represents a letter in the word.
* The user has 10 guesses to decode the word. 
* After 10 guesses, the word will reset. 
* If the user guesses the word, it will track as a "Win". 
* If the user doesn't guess the word, it will track as a "Loss".
* After 3 losses, the game is over.
* After 3 wins, there is a surprise!
