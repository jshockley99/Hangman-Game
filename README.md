# Hangman-Game
This project is based on the traditional hangman game with a twist. It's implemented with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.

Initially, a random "scary themed" word will appear on the page. It will be encrypted with blanks. Each blank represents a letter in the word.

You will have 10 guesses to decode the word.

After 10 guesses, the word will reset. If you guess the word, it will track as a "Win". If you don't guess the word, it will track as a "Loss".

After 3 losses, the game is over.

After 3 wins, there is a surprise!
